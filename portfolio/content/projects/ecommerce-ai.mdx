## Overview

Developed a modern e-commerce platform that combines cutting-edge machine learning with exceptional user experience. The system handles millions of products, provides instant search, and drives revenue through intelligent recommendations.

## The Challenge

Traditional e-commerce platforms suffer from:

- **Poor discovery:** Users can't find products they'd love
- **Slow search:** Full-text search doesn't scale to millions of SKUs
- **Generic experience:** One-size-fits-all product displays
- **Cart abandonment:** 70%+ of carts never convert

Needed a system that felt personal, fast, and conversion-optimized.

## Solution

### AI Recommendation Engine

Built a hybrid recommendation system combining:

**Collaborative Filtering:**
```python
# User-item matrix factorization
model = NMF(n_components=50, random_state=42)
user_features = model.fit_transform(user_item_matrix)
item_features = model.components_

# Generate recommendations
recommendations = user_features @ item_features
```

**Content-Based Filtering:**
- Product embeddings via TF-IDF and Word2Vec
- Cosine similarity for related products
- Category and attribute matching

**Contextual Bandits:**
- Real-time A/B testing of recommendations
- Thompson Sampling for exploration/exploitation
- Personalized based on session behavior

### Search Infrastructure

Implemented Elasticsearch with custom scoring:

```javascript
{
  "query": {
    "function_score": {
      "query": { "multi_match": { "query": "laptop", "fields": ["title^3", "description", "tags^2"] } },
      "functions": [
        { "field_value_factor": { "field": "popularity", "modifier": "log1p" } },
        { "gauss": { "price": { "origin": user.budget, "scale": 200 } } }
      ],
      "boost_mode": "multiply"
    }
  }
}
```

Performance optimizations:
- Index sharding by category
- Autocomplete via edge n-grams
- Faceted search with aggregations
- Query caching for common searches

## Technical Implementation

```

### ML Pipeline

1. **Data Collection:** Track views, clicks, purchases, ratings
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract user/product features
3. **Model Training:** Weekly batch training on historical data
4. **Serving:** FastAPI endpoint with &lt;50ms p95 latency
5. **Monitoring:** Track recommendation CTR and conversion rate

### Performance Optimizations

**Frontend:**
- React Server Components for initial HTML
- Streaming SSR for faster TTFB
- Optimistic UI updates
- Image optimization (AVIF/WebP, lazy loading)

**Backend:**
- Database connection pooling
- Redis caching for product data
- CDN for static assets
- Edge functions for geo-routing

## Results

### Performance

- **Search Latency:** 150ms p95 (down from 2s)
- **Recommendation Latency:** 45ms p95
- **Page Load:** LCP 1.1s on mobile 4G
- **Uptime:** 99.95% over 6 months

### Business Impact

- **35% higher AOV** for users clicking recommendations
- **22% increase** in conversion rate
- **40% lower** bounce rate on search results
- **$2.1M revenue** in first 6 months

### ML Metrics

- **89% accuracy** on held-out test set
- **12% click-through rate** on recommendations
- **3.2x higher** conversion vs. random suggestions

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, Python (FastAPI)
**ML:** TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
**Database:** PostgreSQL, Redis
**Search:** Elasticsearch
**Payments:** Stripe
**Infrastructure:** Vercel, AWS (EC2, RDS, S3), CloudFlare

## Challenges Overcome

### Cold Start Problem

New users had no recommendation history.

**Solution:**
- Popularity-based fallback
- Category affinity from browsing
- Demographic-based defaults
- Quick onboarding quiz (optional)

### Model Staleness

Product catalog changed daily; models trained weekly.

**Solution:**
- Real-time feature updates in Redis
- Hybrid online/offline learning
- Boosting for new products
- Automatic retraining triggers

### Search Relevance

Generic keyword matching returned poor results.

**Solution:**
- Custom scoring with business rules
- Query expansion (synonyms, misspellings)
- Personalized ranking
- Manual tuning for top queries

## Future Enhancements

- Visual search (image → products)
- Voice search integration
- Predictive inventory management
- Multi-language support
- AR try-on for fashion items
